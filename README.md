# Greeble Versions of Logos

Greeble versions of all company logos involved with the BrickMMO project. Currently this includes BrickMMO, Humber, BrevisRefero, and LEGO® logos. Logos will be build using four [standard LEGO baseplates](https://www.lego.com/en-ca/product/gray-baseplate-11024). Final size will be 96 x 96 studes.

## LEGO®

We have constructed a LEGO® logo using LEGO® bricks, buty cannot display the results online due to the [LEGO® Fair Play Policy](https://www.lego.com/en-ca/legal/notices-and-policies/fair-play/?locale=en-ca).

## Greeble

Greeble is defined as "small pieces of detailing added to break up the surface of an object and add visual interest" ~ Wikipedia. LEGO greebling is a common building technique used in the LEGO community:

### Types of Greebling

There are two types of greebling in BrickMMO projects:

- Heavy Greebling: Greebling covers every stud. Greebling can be as high as three standard LEGO blocks, but should mostly be around one.
- Light Geebling: Greebling covers most studs. Greebling should mostly be under one standard LEGO block.

### Rules for Greebling

When working on BrickMMO projects and adding greebling to a project, follow these rules:

1. A stud is covered when any part of a LEGO brick covers any part of a stud.
2. Use as few pieces as possible to cover studs.
3. If you want to add a complex piece to the greeble, use as few pieces as needed to add the piece.
